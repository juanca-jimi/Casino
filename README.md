<h2>Where This Application Originated</h2>

__This application originated from a Roulette homework assignment__
<br/><br/>
After gaining a deeper understanding of seperations of concerns I realized that this code was monolithic. 
To help it adapt to future change and maintenance I began making an effort to take it from monolithic to loosely coupled.

<h2>Goals</h2>

The application is currently seperated into classes that now perform each specific task but is broken. 
<br/><br/>
Now I'm going to make it function as a __casino__ game instead of roulette application. I am only going to work on the roulette aspect of it for now but if in the future we want to implement 
any other games this should not be a problem.
<br/><br/>
Further progress in making a pleasant user experience will be performed last but is part of making the application as intuitive for the user as possible.
